My Name is Hengjia Zhang(张恒嘉). Currently I'm a master student major in Computer Science and Engineering at the Univeristy of Michigan and planning to graduate in May, 2020. I got dual degrees in Computer Science at the University of Michigan and in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

Right now I'm a deep learning intern in the Mathworks and working on pre-trained Keras Model transformation in MATLAB. Before that I was a Graduate Student Instructor at UM for EECS 486 Web Search and Information Retrieval, where I led discussion session, held office hour and created exams for the students.
